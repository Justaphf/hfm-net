## Version 0.9.12.839

### Release Date: March 23, 2020

* Fix: Issue 302 HFM sometimes closes (crashes) when a v7 client connection is lost
* Fix: Issue 303 Incorrect status for slot 1+ when no work on slot 0
* Fix: DataGridView System.IndexOutOfRangeException when removing clients/slots
* Fix: Client grid sorting and work unit history grid sorting now persists between grid refreshes
* Fix: Connection issue to folding.extremeoverclocking.com stats

* Change: Remove legacy (v6 and prior) client support
* Change: Add additional support for OPENMM_22 core
* Change: Add detection for clients reporting "Too many errors, failing" after too many UNKNOWN_ENUM results


## Version 0.9.11.815

### Release Date: August 11, 2019

* Change: Update for changed F@H psummary API (merged PR 301 by jcoffland)
          If you've experienced HFM not reporting the correct PPD/Credit for quick return bonus (QRB) projects, then install this update and manually download the project summary.


## Version 0.9.10.811

### Release Date: January 12, 2019

* Fix: Don't allow config.xml read errors to stop HFM from loading.  Load default values if this situation occurs.
* Fix (Issue 300): Web Generation - include ClientVersion, TotalRunCompletedUnits, TotalCompletedUnits, TotalRunFailedUnits, and TotalFailedUnits in SlotData structure in web xml data.
* Fix: Web Generation - format production (PPD, UPD, Credit) numbers that were not being formatted according to the user preferences.

* Change: UI - failed unit count now toggles between "current run" and "total" just like completed unit count.
* Change: v7 client interface - allowing CPU and OS values from v7 client to fully flow into the queue viewer.
          Was previously doing some checks and parsing on this data which required code updates for each new
          CPU or OS.  This could result in some failed detections when the application isn't updated to detect
          a new CPU or OS.  That's too much maintenance, so the values reported by the client are now used verbatim.


## Version 0.9.9.789

### Release Date: January 1, 2019

* Change: Log viewer and message viewer font changed to Consolas 10pt.  The mono-space font makes reading the log much better on the eyes.
* Change: Auto updates source location.  HFM will auto update from v0.9.8 for a short time.  But it will begin to fail soon.
          I've maintained some paid web hosting over the years that I intended to do more with.  At this point I've decided to cut 
		  my losses there as there are many more options now.  The new update location should do well for the foreseeable future.
* Change: Lots of things behind the scenes.  I won't bore you with the details.  These are all things I've been working on for the last few
          years, as time has allowed, to make the application leaner and meaner.  Again, users won't really care, unless I created a bug.

* Notes: I hope those of you using the project enjoy.  If you have an issue please post in the Google Group or add a new Issue here on GitHub.
         I'll do my best to respond as quickly as possible.  I'm working my way through the Issues here on GitHub to clean them up, some of 
		 them are very old and were imported from Google Code.


## Version 0.9.8.615

### Release Date: May 12, 2017

* Change: Upgrade to .NET v4.5.2

* Enhancement: Add detection of Windows 10 OS via FAHClient v7 interface.
* Enhancement: Add detection for core 0xA7.

* Fix: On Work Unit History CSV export, format date/time and floating point values using invariant culture.  
       Provides consistent data regardless of the host machine's locale settings.


## Version 0.9.7.558

### Release Date: September 6, 2016

* Change: Reworked HFM's FAH Log File Parsing API.  Changes targeted to make v7 log files a first class citizen in lieu of of being a derivation of v6 logs.
          As a result HFM as a client application does much less repeated parsing and scanning of the log data which results in less memory usage and faster client data processing.
          I'm also curious to see how well GPU work unit failures are now captured from v7 clients.  I don't have any modern GPUs so this is obviously difficult for me to test.

* Change/Fix: Replaced the preferences/configuration storage mechanism (user.config) which has been a source of random problems since HFM's inception.
              Existing preferences will migrate to the new (home rolled) storage mechanism.  The new preferences can be found in the HFM data files folder (config.xml).

* Fix: Crash reported by john on the hfm-net Google Group.  He discovered a race condition between HFM attempting to write to the cached log.txt file while the web
       generation also attempts to upload (read) the same log.txt file via FTP, and vice-versa.  HFM will attempt either operation multiple times before timing out and 
       also fail graciously in lieu of tearing the process down.  Neither I/O operation is critical to the long term health of the process.


## Version 0.9.6.501

### Release Date: June 19, 2016

* Fix: Change the default Project Summary download URL for new installs to http://assign.stanford.edu/api/project/summary.

* Enhancement: Right-click context menu now includes commands to Fold, Pause, and Finish the FAH client slot.
* Enhancement: Work Unit History data can now be exported to csv through the File menu of the Work Unit History window.

* Change: Reworked HFM's FAH v7 client interface API.
* Change: Reworked FAH v7 client handling code.  Testing has shown faster retrieval times of the log.txt file through the FAH v7 client API.


## Version 0.9.5.478

### Release Date: February 7, 2016

* Fix/Update: Use project summary JSON feed for project (work unit) information in lieu of parsing psummary.html.
